title: Inclusion and Accommodation
---

## Intro

Conferences, websites, organizations, and workplaces can unwittingly exclude people who differ from the mainstream. This page collects resources to help include more people by accommodating differences.

## Advantages

Some organisers don't see immediate advantages of making their conferences, web sites, or groups more inclusive. Often they say something like "if someone who needs \[an accomodation\] wants to attend or join, we will do it then." But in many cases the absence (or invisibility) of accomodations is keeping those people from trying to attend or join.

This [Twitter thread by @MalwareTechBlog](https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1213945008174190592) describes a surprising benefit of removing toxic users: a sudden growth in the activity on the server by the "ordinary" users who had been quietly uncomfortable while those users were dominating the discussion. Other pre-emptive accomodations could well yield similar results.
